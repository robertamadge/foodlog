## Doc - Pull Request

**You can find the documentation on the `README.md` of the project or at [BookStacks]()**

**The template for the pull request can be found in a folder called `.github.md` on each one of the projects**


1. Pull requests need to follow the specifications from the Pull Request Template to be authorized;
2. Write in the title the code from the Jira’s task - [FF-XXX] - and the link if applicable, otherwise, write a title to specify the task and explain in the description that there is no task on Jira;
3. It is recommended to put a description of the change performed by the task if this is not already described in Jira’s task;
4. Proposed changes can be set like a bulleted list containing information about these changes;
5. Mentions can contain the name of the people that are responsible for analyzing proposed changes;
6. The checklist can be marked while the analysis is being made;
7. It is recommended to put screenshots, pictures or videos to better analyze;
8. Additional Info can be used to put links from other tools or anything relevant to be analyzed afterwards;
9. If after the analysis someone finds a problem they must create a thread on the line that the problem occurred or if the problem is general they need to put a comment into the Discussion part;
10. If there are open threads the merge should not proceed. Ideally put a review marked as requested changes to block the merge.
